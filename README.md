## Overview
This lab project focuses on writing methods on a Stack Class using a Linked List for storage. This is implementing a LIFO or last in, first out) method of storage.
____
The ```push(value)``` method adds a node and value to the end/top of the linked list.

The ```pop()``` method on the stack removes the last node.

  The ```peek()``` method on the stack returns the value of the last/top node in storage.

  The ```isEmpty()``` method checks if the storage is empty.
